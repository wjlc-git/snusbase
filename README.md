# snusbase
This is all the files that make-up the snusbase beta frontend, this DOESN'T allow you to use the tools without login, or anything like that. If you want to use the tools, just use them? This isn't for people to get anything important or illegal out of it, it's simply to see the information easier, and how the frontend operates.
